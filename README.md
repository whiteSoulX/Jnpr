# 🐉 DRAGON KEY PUZZLE LOGIN

Welcome to a project that isn't just another login page...  
This is **a gate**, a **challenge**, and a **secret** that only the worthy will pass.

---

## 💡 What's This?

We’re building a **puzzle-based login system** — but with a twist.

- 🔐 You don’t just enter your name or password.
- 🧩 You **solve visual puzzles** to get the secret key.
- ⏱ If you fail three times? You're locked out for **3 hours**.
- 🌍 Hosted with **GitHub Pages** — accessible from **anywhere** in the world.

This isn't your typical front-end project.  
This is a challenge. An invitation. A warning.  
> _"You know what you need to do."_
